# Hey, I'm James 👋

**Information Systems & Technology** student at Cal State San Bernardino (CSUSB), focused on cybersecurity, networking, and building systems that actually work.

I learn best by building things and breaking them on purpose. Most of what you'll find here comes from my homelab, school projects, and curiosity that wouldn't leave me alone.

Documented from hardware specs to the debugging stories.

## 📌 About This GitHub

I use this as a living record of what I'm learning and building. Early commits are rough — that's the point. If I don't know how to do something, I'll figure it out. That's not a gap, that's the process. If you're a recruiter, the thing I'd want you to notice is that I show up consistently, learn what I need to, and document what I do.
